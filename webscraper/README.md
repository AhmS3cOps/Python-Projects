## **Description**
This project demonstrates a simple **web scraper** built with Python.  
It extracts both **internal discussion links** and **external article links** from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using the `requests` library for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML.

The scraper highlights the difference between links that point to Hacker News discussions (internal) and those that lead to outside articles (external).

---

## **Features**
- Fetches live HTML from Hacker News.  
- Parses and extracts all `<a>` tags.  
- Filters:  
  - Internal links â†’ Hacker News discussion threads (`item?id=`).  
  - External links â†’ Articles (URLs starting with `http://` or `https://`).  
- Prints results in a clean numbered format.  
- Includes screenshots of sample runs.
