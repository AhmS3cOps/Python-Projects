## **Description**
This repository contains multiple **Python-based projects**, each demonstrating core concepts in automation, cybersecurity, and scripting.  
Currently, it includes:
- A **Web Scraper** that extracts article links and titles from Hacker News.  
- A **Password Cracking Demonstration** using a dictionary attack with the MD6 hashing algorithm.  

Each project is documented with its own dedicated README file.

### 2. Dictionary Attack Password Cracker
- **Folder**: `/password_cracker`  
- **Description**:  
  Demonstrates how weak passwords can be cracked using a dictionary attack.  
  - Uses **MD5** to hash a sample password from the Linux terminal.  
  - Cracking logic implemented in Python using **MD6** for illustrative purposes.  
  - Iterates through a wordlist to find the original password.  
- **Output**: Shows the cracking process and when the password is discovered.  
- **Docs**: See the [Password Cracker README](password_cracker/README.md).
